 * Pure renderer for the success reply to an ``@bgagent`` comment-iteration
 * (A6/#299 — the question-vs-edit fix).
 *
 * Background: every ``@bgagent`` comment on a PR-bearing issue spawns a
 * ``coding/pr-iteration-v1`` task. When that task completes + builds, the
 * platform replied "✅ Updated — PR #N" UNCONDITIONALLY — even when the comment
 * was a QUESTION ("where is the login page?") and the agent made no commit. That
 * read as a false success: a "✅ Updated" with nothing updated and the question
 * unanswered.
 *
 * The agent now persists ``code_changed`` (did the branch HEAD advance?) and,
 * on a no-change run, ``answer_text`` (its reply to the question). This renderer
 * branches on that:
 *   - code changed (or unknown — back-compat) → "✅ Updated — PR #N." (as before)
 *   - no code changed                         → "💬 <answer>" (no false ✅)
 *
 * Pure + no I/O so both settle paths (the standalone fanout reply and the
 * orchestration reconciler) render identically and it is unit-testable.
